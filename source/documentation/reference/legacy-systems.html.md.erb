# Legacy Systems

Any new digital service will, to a greater or lesser degree, need to integrate
with one or more of our legacy services. Usually, although not always, this will
take the form of reading data from a legacy services' API, and emitting a domain
event that can be consumed by a legacy service.

On this page you'll find a rundown of the four main legacy systems and who to
speak to start your journey with integrating with them.

## NOMIS (Prisons)

National Offender Management Information System (NOMIS) is the current
authority system for information management and administrations of HMPPS
Prisons. Developed by [Syscon](https://syscon.net/), it was originally
deployed into HMPPS xx years ago but is suffering from a number of constrains
typical for a system of this age:

As such a programme of work is underway to replace NOMIS with a new suite of
digital solutions.

## Delius (Probation)

Delius (also known as NDelius for National Delius) is the main case/person
management system used by Probation Practitioners to manage people on
probation (community licenses).

### Getting the data

There are a number of APIs that can be used to access data stored in NDelius,
but it is recommended that in the first instance you post a message in
[#probation-integration-tech](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C02HQ4M2YQN)

### Environments

- Dev (aka Test): https://ndelius.test.probation.service.justice.gov.uk

Contains synthetic data and requires no special clearance (other than standard
HMPPS controls). Not connected to any OASys environments.

- PreProd: https://ndelius.preprod.probation.service.justice.gov.uk

PreProd contains data copied directly from Prod - this is usually
refreshed monthly. As such Security Clearance is required to access PreProd. In
PreProd, OASys and NDelius exchange Offender and Assessment data via NDH.

- Prod: https://ndelius.probation.service.justice.gov.uk

Prod contains live data, as such Security Clearance is required. It is highly
unusual for anyone other than frontline staff to need access to Prod. In Prod,
OASys and NDelius exchange Offender and Assessment data via NDH.

## PPUD (Probation and Prison)

Public Protection Unit Database (PPUD) is used for various Public Protection
purposes, including managing parole, managing recalls, managing mental health
transfers and managing serious complaints and incidents.

It is developed and supported by [Lumen](https://www.lumen.com/en-us/home.html). See
[PPUD](https://dsdmoj.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ARN/pages/4232904898/PPUD+and+OASys+overlapping+data)
for some useful context.

### Getting the data

There is currently no API available to enable integrations with PPUD. In the
first instance contact the
[#hmpps-technical-architecture](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/CEUQKFNCS)
channel.

### Environments

- Dev (known as dev/test): https://internaltest.ppud.justice.gov.uk

Contains synthetic data and requires no special clearance (other than standard
HMPPS controls).

- PreProd (known as UAT): https://uat.ppud.justice.gov.uk

UAT contains data copied and pseudo-anonymised from Prod - this is usually
refreshed 3/4 times each year. As such Security Clearance is required to access
UAT or Prod.

- Prod: https://www.ppud.justice.gov.uk

Prod contains live data, as such Security Clearance is required. It is highly
unusual for anyone other than frontline staff to need access to Prod.

## OASys (Probation and Prison)

Offender Assessment System (OASys) which manages most of the risk assessments
and sentence plans across both the Probation and
Prison Services.

OASys is a Oracle APEX application hosted in MoJ's Azure fix-n-go environment.

Also see the [Assess Risks and
Needs](https://dsdmoj.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ARN/overview?homepageId=2358771974)
project.

### Getting the data

There are a number of APIs that can be used to access data stored in OASys, but
it is recommended that in the first instance you post a message in
[#probation-integration-tech](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C02HQ4M2YQN)

### Environments

- Dev (known as t1): https://ords.t1.oasys.service.justice.gov.uk

Contains synthetic data and requires no special clearance (other than standard
HMPPS controls). Not connected to any NDelius environments.

- PreProd : https://pp-oasys.az.justice.gov.uk

PreProd contains data copied from Prod - this is usually refreshed on a weekly
basis (on Sunday evenings). As such Security Clearance is required to access
PreProd.

- Prod : https://oasys.az.justice.gov.uk

Prod contains live data, as such Security Clearance is required. It is highly
unusual for anyone other than frontline staff to need access to Prod. In Prod,
OASys and NDelius exchange Offender and Assessment data via NDH.

There are also additional environments, T2, Training and Practice that are used,
but can be ignored for most purposes.

## NDH (Prison and Probation)

Not a user-facing service, but a legacy component that exchanges data between
NOMIS, NDelius and OASys. You're unlikely to need to know too much about this,
but it may be good to know of its existence, especially if you're looking to
integrate with multiple legacy services.

New digital services will use Domain Events and APIs to facilitate data
exchanges between systems.
