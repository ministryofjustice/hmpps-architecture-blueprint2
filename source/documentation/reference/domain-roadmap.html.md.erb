# Domain Roadmap

The two primary aspects driving the DPS project are

- The need to displace NOMIS by the end of 2026
- The desire to transform business processes

These aspects are somewhat in competition with each other - a focus on one
will naturally diminish focus on the other.

## Work Trajectory

![](../../images/offnomis-transformation-matrix.png)

In the general case, domains teams should align to the standard work
trajectory - focussing on getting off NOMIS and incorporating user-centered
maintenance screen improvements but do not necessarily transform business
processes. If a team believes it appropriate to deviate far from this
trajectory - to incorporate significant transformation business change for
example - the team should approach the DPS Strategy Team to present this case
and gain approval for this approach.

## Deployment Priority

### Core domains

Many other domains are dependent on this domain's data meaning that the
highest priority components are those which remove the dependency on NOMIS
APIs i.e. the Domain/Subdomain APIs and Domain Events.

If we then consider that business value has the next highest priority, the
next component to look at is the user interface and any required
orchestration. This new UI can enable augmentation of the NOMIS data as
required.

The final components to be considered are the data storage microservices which
once populate, allow NOMIS storage to be switched off.

### Non-core domains with low business transformation

The component which provides most business value earliest is the user
interface and as such, this is the top priority item. Next in line are the
microservices & events.

A team may consider implementing microservices at the same time as the UI and
this is acceptable providing this does not adversely affect the standard work
trajectory - or unless dispensation from the DPS strategy team to adopt this
approach has been granted. If this more holistic approach is taken, it is
recommended that the domain is "migrated" to microservices on a sub-domain by
sub-domain basis.

Once a sub-domain of data is strangled from NOMIS, other sub-domains may
follow.

### Non-core domains with high business transformation

No other domains are dependent on this domain's data - the domain team is not
constrained by having to reduce the impact of this dependency. The priority
driver for this domain is business transformation - the drive to get off NOMIS
exists but is of lower priority in the short term.

Domain solution should align to the DPS architectural pattern but the team is
largely free to construct and release components of this pattern in the order
which best addresses the business need. The domain team is must publish and
keep to a roadmap which includes timescales for "getting off NOMIS". These
timescales should align to DPS strategic objectives.

## Target Delivery Dates

- Take ownership of key prison data by end of 2023/24
- Users will be able to manage activities and appointments on DPS by Autumn
  2024
- Prisoner's journeys into, out of and around the prison estate will be
  managed on DPS by 2025
- Case administration will be carried out on DPS by 2025
- Users will be able to manage safety of prisoners on DPS by 2025
