# Architectural Principles

## Higher Level Abstract Principles

- Emergent design over upfront design
- High-level long-term options over detailed long-term design
- Microservices over monoliths
- Data services over databases
- Boundaries of responsibility over shared ownership

Aligning to: [MOJ Architecture Principles for Justice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XBTuCw0y--4fZpHcTLWilSFx_qz3aewTiWYJGTZU4sA/edit)

## Principles in Practice

- Digital Prison Services (DPS) will be architected as a set of
  loosely-coupled, "right-sized" (Domains?) services, each owned and supported
  for their life-time by teams of dedicated professionals. These will be built
  with a single user experience and to GDS standards.
- Domain Services will be recognised as key authority systems responsible for
  their own data. Domain service delivery teams must ensure that their
  domain's data is available to downstream services as required - both via an
  API and for reporting and data analytics purposes.
- Core prison data must be retrieved from the appropriate domain API. NOMIS
  should no-longer be considered the source of truth for prison data. In the
  short to medium term, data can be synchronised back to NOMIS to satisfy
  downstream dependencies.
- Domain Services will integrate in a loosely coupled way using Events and
  APIs. Domains services are responsible keeping themselves aligned to the
  current prisons state by listening out for event of interest and performing
  internal processing accordingly.
- Data should not be duplicated data across prison and probation services
  unless it is absolutely necessary - e.g. for reasons of performance or
  resilience

## Security Principles

HMPPS Digital aims to provide technical solutions that are “Secure By Design”
and aligned to MoJ Digital and Justice architecture principles and security
guidance.

- Emergent design over upfront design - security needs to be a continuous
  consideration
- Know the limitations of your architecture - security testing to understand
  our risks
- Open-source over closed-source - Secure development practices enabling
  “coding in the open”
- Continuous delivery over change management
- Public cloud by default
- Trust but verify code
- Secure systems over secure zones
- Immutable infrastructure over patch-in-place
- Audit, Audit, Audit
