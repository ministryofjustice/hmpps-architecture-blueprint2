# HMPPS Services: Technical Architecture

## User interface

[User Interfaces](/documentation/tutorials/building-a-service.html#user-interfaces)
provide facilities to view, create, manage and maintain the domain's data. It
is likely that the user interface will require data from other domains and
these may be retrieved by accessing their respective domain APis.

### Orchestration Layer

This organises the data required by the front end service into a readily
consumable form. It is recommended that a dedicated service is deployed to
contain this orchestration from the outset. If it is known that this will
always be simple, a domain team may consider incorporating this orchestration
into the front end service.

### Domain APIs

The Domain APIs are used to gain access to a domain's data.
[This area](/documentation/tutorials/building-a-service.html#microservices)
contains further detail.

### Subdomain Microservices

These store and manage the domain's data. There is no hard and fast rule on
how big or small these microservices should be - they should be "just big
enough" and "not too big". Further detail is available
[here](/documentation/tutorials/building-a-service.html#microservices).

Even if implemented with a number of microservices, **domain data** may be
stored in single instance of a Cloud Platform provided AWS RDS PostgreSQL
database. Procurement details maybe be found
